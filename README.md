Monte Carlo Backtesting of a Moving Average Trading Strategy in Simulated Markets

Purpose:
I built a stock price simulator with a moving-average trading rule. I then used a Monte Carlo simulation to test whether it beats a baseline hold-only strategy.

I analysed performance statistically afterwards to determine results (i.e. if it's worth it)


Whis project is supposed to show

- Python for financial modelling

- Monte Carlo simulation

- Strategy backtesting

- Comparing against baseline performance

- Understanding of market noise vs signal
